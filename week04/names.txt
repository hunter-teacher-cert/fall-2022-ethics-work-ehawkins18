I spoke with Hugh Jass at the party. 
He told me that Amanda Hugginkiss was in love with Seymor Butts. 
Mr. Jones then slapped Ms. C. Ulater because she was having an affair with his best friend The Gooch. 
This angered Mrs. H. Simpson because she thought very highly of Maya Buttreeks.
They decided to go to a Frank Zappa concert. 
He played a cover of Dr. Feelgood by Motley Crue.
For an encore, Mr. Zappa moderated a discussion on the architectual styles of Frank Lloyd Wright and I. M. Pei.
I then realized that I had completed the assignment without mentioning Mike Z. or Topher Mykolyk. What a mistake!!!
