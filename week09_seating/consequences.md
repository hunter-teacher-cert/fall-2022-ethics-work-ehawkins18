Article: [Unintended Consequences of Implementing a National Performance Measurement System into Local Practice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3304045/)
To quote this article on the ethical concerns of implementing Performance Measurement Systems in healthcare: "Participants noted both positive effects and negative unintended consequences of PM. We report three negative unintended consequences for patients. Performance measurement can (1) lead to inappropriate clinical care, (2) decrease provider focus on patient concerns and patient service, and (3) compromise patient education and autonomy. We also illustrate examples of negative consequences on primary care team dynamics. In many instances these problems originate from local implementation strategies developed in response to national PM definitions and policies."
